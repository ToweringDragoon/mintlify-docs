title: "Operator Submits Tasking"
---

There's a lot of moving pieces within Mythic and its agents, so it's helpful to take a step back and see how messages are flowing between the different components.

    participant O as Operator
    participant M as Mythic
    participant P as Payload Container
    O ->>+ M: Issues Task
    M ->> M: Validate Operator Can Submit Task
    M ->> M: Creates Preprocessing Task
    M -->>- O: Indicate new task exists
    M ->>+ P: Forward Task
    P ->> P: Parse Arguments
    P ->> P: Validate Arguments
    P ->> P: Perform OPSEC Pre-Check
    loop create_tasking
        P -->> M: Use RPC Functionality
        M -->> P: RPC Replies
    end
    Note over P: Finish Processing
    P ->> P: Perform OPSEC Post-Check
    P -->>- M: Send finished task
    M ->> M: Updates Task to Submitted or Error
    M -->> O: Update with new Task Status
```

Here we can see an operator issue tasking to the Mythic server. The Mythic server registers the task as "preprocessing" and informs the operator that it got the task. Mythic then sends the task off to the corresponding Payload Type container for processing. The container looks up the corresponding command python file, parses the arguments, validates the arguments, and passes the resulting parameters to the create\_tasking function. This function can leverage a bunch of RPC functionality going back to Mythic to register files, send output, etc. When it's done, it sends the final parameters back to Mythic which updates the Task to either `Submitted` or `Error`. Now that the task is out of the `preprocessing` state, when an agent checks in, it can receive the task.
