title: "7. Redirect Rules"
---

## What is it?

This is a function operators can manually invoke for a payload to ask the payload's C2 profiles to generate a set of redirection rules for that payload. Nothing in Mythic knows more about a specific C2 profile than the C2 profile itself, so it makes sense that a C2 profile should be able to generate its own redirection rules for a given payload.

These redirection rules are up to the C2 Profile creators, but can include things like Apache mod\_rewrite rules, Nginx configurations, and more.

## Where is it?

Operationally, users can invoke this function from the created payloads page with a dropdown menu for the payload they're interested in. Functionally, this code lives in the class definition of your C2 Profile.

## What does it look like?

This function gets passed the same sort of information that the opsec check and configuration check functions get; namely, information about all of the payload's supplied c2 profile parameter values. This function can also access the C2 Profile's current configuration.

The format of the function is as follows:
