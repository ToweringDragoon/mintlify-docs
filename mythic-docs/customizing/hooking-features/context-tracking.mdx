## Tasking Context Tabs

Mythic allows you to track a bunch of different attributes about your callback as little "tabs" right above where you issue tasks.
This allows you to have a quick access to a few pieces of information without having to look back up at the top table.

The default tracking shows the `impersonation_context` and `cwd` attributes of a callback.

In your user settings you can change what fields you want displayed (if any) and what color you want them to be.

### cwd and impersonation_context

Using the `callback` keyword, agents can update any part of a callback as part of a task response.
This data can also be set as part of your initial checkin data.

#### As part of a task

As part of a task, you can use another keyword, `callback` to send the following structure.
Inside the `callback` key you can set anything that you could when checking in.

```json
"responses": [
    {
        "task_id": "some uuid here",
        "callback": {
            "cwd": "C:\\Users\\tywin.lannister\\Desktop", //optional
            "impersonation_context": "sevenkingdoms.local\\",
            "sleep_info": "some string",
            "pid": 2345,
            "extra_info": "something else"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Not as part of a task

Sometimes you have other aspects to your agent that might be monitoring or running tasks and you want to report that data back to the user, but you don't have a specific task to associate it with. In that case, you can do the exact same `alerts` structure, but at a higher level in the structure:

```json
{
    "action": "checkin", // any action
    "cwd": "C:\\Users\\tywin.lannister\\Desktop",
    "pid": 12334,
    "user": "tywin.lannister",
    "domain": "sevenkingdoms.local"
}
```
