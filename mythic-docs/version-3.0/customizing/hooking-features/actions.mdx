## What are actions?

Actions are special messages that don't adhere to the normal message types that you see for the rest of the features in this section. There are only a handful of these messages:

* [Action: checkin](/version-3.0/customizing/payload-type-development/create_tasking/agent-side-coding/initial-checkin) - Initial checkin messages and key exchanges

* [Action: get\_tasking](/version-3.0/customizing/payload-type-development/create_tasking/agent-side-coding/action_get_tasking) - Getting tasking

* [Action: post\_response](/version-3.0/customizing/payload-type-development/create_tasking/agent-side-coding/action-post_response) - Sending tasking responses
  * Inside of this is where the features listed throughout this section appear
