## MythicRPC in 2.2.7+

The RPC functionality within Mythic as of 2.2.7 is more dynamic, allowing more functionality to be added to the back-end and automatically usable by the Payload Type containers without requiring new PyPi packages or new Docker images. To facilitate this, you can always get the latest RPC available functionality within your tasking via:

```
from mythic_payloadtype_container.MythicRPC import *
import sys

async def create_tasking(self, task: MythicTask) -> MythicTask:
        resp = await MythicRPC().get_functions()
        print(resp.response)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        return task
```

That will print out all of the information for the available functions if you're ever in doubt about what's available or how to call the functions. When you find a function you want to call, you do it as follows:

```
file_resp = await MythicRPC().execute("create_file", task_id=task.id,
                file=base64.b64encode(task.args.get_arg("file_id")).decode(),
                saved_file_name=original_file_name,
                delete_after_fetch=False,
            )
```

where you always call `await MythicRPC().execute` with the first parameter being the name of the function to call and all of the other arguments being passed in like normal function arguments.

## 2.3.0+ Functions

The function set is moving towards a standard nomenclature - `create_*` for when you want to create/register/add something to the database, `get_*` for when you want to fetch something from the database, and `delete_*` when you want to remove something from the database or mark it as deleted. The current set of functionality for 2.2.8 is as follows:

```
create_file(task_id: int, file: str, delete_after_fetch: bool = True, saved_file_name: str = None, is_screenshot: bool = False, is_download: bool = False, remote_path: str = None, host: str = None) -> dict
    Creates a FileMeta object in Mythic's database and writes contents to disk with a random UUID filename.
    This file can then be fetched via the returned file UUID.
    :param task_id: The ID number of the task performing this action (task.id)
    :param file: The base64 contents of the file to register
    :param delete_after_fetch: Should Mythic delete the file from disk after the agent fetches it. This also marks the file as deleted in the UI. This is useful if the file is a temporary file that doesn't necessarily need long-term tracking within Mythic.
    :param saved_file_name: The name of the file (if none supplied, a random UUID4 value will be used)
    :param is_screenshot: Is this file a screenshot reported by the agent? If so, this will cause it to show up in the screenshots page.
    :param is_download: Is this file the result of downloading something from the agent? If so, this will cause it to show up in the Files page under Downloads
    :param remote_path: Does this file exist on target? If so, provide the full remote path here
    :param host: If this file exists on a target host, indicate it here in conjunction with the remote_path argument
    :return: Dict of a FileMeta object
    Example: this takes two arguments - ParameterType.String for `remote_path` and ParameterType.File for `file`
        async def create_tasking(self, task: MythicTask) -> MythicTask:
            try:
                original_file_name = json.loads(task.original_params)["file"]
                if len(task.args.get_arg("remote_path")) == 0:
                    task.args.add_arg("remote_path", original_file_name)
                elif task.args.get_arg("remote_path")[-1] == "/":
                    task.args.add_arg("remote_path", task.args.get_arg("remote_path") + original_file_name)
                file_resp = await MythicRPC().execute("create_file", task_id=task.id,
                    file=base64.b64encode(task.args.get_arg("file")).decode(),
                    saved_file_name=original_file_name,
                    delete_after_fetch=False,
                )
                if file_resp.status == MythicStatus.Success:
                    task.args.add_arg("file", file_resp.response["agent_file_id"])
                    task.display_params = f"{original_file_name} to {task.args.get_arg('remote_path')}"
                else:
                    raise Exception("Error from Mythic: " + str(file_resp.error))
            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception("Error from Mythic: " + str(sys.exc_info()[-1].tb_lineno) + str(e))
            return task
```

get_file(task_id: int = None, callback_id: int = None, filename: str = None, limit_by_callback: bool = True, max_results: int = 1, file_id: str = None, get_contents: bool = True) -> dict
    Get file data and contents by name (ex: from create_file and a specified saved_file_name parameter).
    The search can be limited to just this callback (or the entire operation) and return just the latest or some number of matching results.
    :param task_id: The ID number of the task performing this action (task.id) - if this isn't provided, the callback id must be provided
    :param callback_id: The ID number of the callback for this action - if this isn't provided, the task_id must be provided
    :param filename: The name of the file to search for (Case sensitive)
    :param file_id: If no filename specified, then can search for a specific file by this UUID
    :param limit_by_callback: Set this to True if you only want to search for files that are tied to this callback. This is useful if you're doing this as part of another command that previously loaded files into this callback's memory.
    :param max_results: The number of results you want back. 1 will be the latest file uploaded with that name, -1 will be all results.
    :param get_contents: Boolean of if you want to fetch file contents or just metadata
    :return: An array of dictionaries representing the FileMeta objects of all matching files. When "get_contents" is True, each entry in this array will also have a "contents" key with the base64 representation of the associated file if it hasn't been deleted, or None if it has.
    For an example-
    resp = await MythicRPC().execute("get_file", task_id=task.id, filename="myAssembly.exe")
    resp.response <--- this is an array
    resp.response[0] <--- this is the most recently registered matching file where filename="myAssembly.exe"
    resp.response[0]["filename"] <-- the filename of that first result
    resp.response[0]["contents"] <--- the base64 representation of that file
    All of the possible dictionary keys are available at https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/blob/master/mythic-docker/app/database_models/model.py for the FileMeta class
```

    :param file_id: This is the string UUID identifier for the file
    :param comment: If you want to update the comment on the file, supply the text here
    :param delete_after_fetch: If you want this file to be deleted after an agent fetches it, set this to True. It's false by default.
    :param contents: Supply the raw bytes of the file if you want to update the contents.
    :param filename: Supply a new filename for the file
    :return: Success or error code
```

```
get_payload(payload_uuid: str, get_contents: bool = True) -> dict
    Get information about a payload and its contents
    :param payload_uuid: The UUID for the payload you're interested in

    :param update_deleted: True or False indicating if this file browser data should be used to automatically update deleted files for the listed folder. This defaults to false, but if set to true and there are files that Mythic knows about for this folder that the passed-in data doesn't include, it will be marked as deleted.

                         group_callback_function: str = None) -> dict:
    Issue a new task to the current callback as a child of the current task.
    You can use the "subtask_callback_function" to provide the name of the function you want to call when this new task enters a "completed=True" state.
    If you issue create_subtask_group, the group name and group callback functions are propagated here.
    You MUST provide params_string or params_dict to this function, but you don't provide both.
    :param parent_task_id: The id of the current task (task.id)
    :param command: The name of the command you want to use
    :param params_string: The string parameters you want to issue to that command (this gets passed to the command's parse_arguments function)
    :param params_dict: THe dictionary of parameters you want to issue to that command (this will get converted into a string and passed to that command's parse_arguments function)
    :param files: If you want to pass along a file to the task, provide it here (example provided)
    :param subtask_callback_function: The name of the function to call on the _parent_ task when this function exits
    :param subtask_group_name: An optional name of a group so that tasks can share a single callback function
    :param tags: A list of strings of tags you want to apply to this new task
    :param group_callback_function: If you're grouping tasks together, this is the name of the shared callback function for when they're all in a "completed=True" state
    :return: Information about the task you just created
    If the command for your subtask normally takes a parameter of type File, then we need to do something a little bit differently for you to pass that along to the subtask.
    Let's say you want to call the "upload" command which takes a `path` argument which is a string and a `file` argument which is a type of File.
    To call this as a subtask you'd need to pass in:
        MythicRPC().execute("create_subtask", parent_task_id=task.id, command="upload", params_dict={"path": "/wherever", "file": "filename"}, files={"file": "base64 file contents"})
    Notice here that in the parameters piece, the "file" value is the filename and in the "files" parameter, we associated it with the file contents.
    This allows us to save off the filename in the task's "original_params" while still getting access to the contents in the "params" value.

    :param parent_task_id: The id of the parent task (i.e. task.id)
    :param tasks: An array of dictionaries representing the tasks to create. An example is shown below.
    :param subtask_group_name: The name for the group. If one isn't provided, a random UUID will be used instead
    :param tags: An optional list of tags to apply to all of the subtasks created.
    :param group_callback_function: The name of the function to call in the _parent_ task when all of these subtasks are done.
    :return: An array of dictionaries representing information about all of the subtasks created.
```

## Calling C2 RPC Functions

Your Payload Type container can actually call RPC functions defined within your C2 profile as well. You must have Mythic 2.2.8 and a PayloadType container version of at least 9 to leverage this functionality. These just have a slightly different format:

```
resp = await MythicRPC().execute_c2rpc(c2_profile="http", function_name="test", task_id=task.id,
        message="hi")
```

The key things to notice here are:

1. the function you execute is called `execute_c2rpc` instead of just `execute`

2. The `message` parameter is always a string. If you need to send a dictionary to your C2 profile, use `json.dumps({dictionary here})` (make sure you `import json` at the top)

3. Your response back will have the same `status` , `response`, and `error` as the other kind of RPC functions.

### Defining your own C2 RPC Functions

If you are creating your own C2, you can create your own C2 RPC functions! Inside of your `mythic/c2_functions` folder for your C2 Profile, create a file called `C2_RPC_functions.py` (it might already exist for you). This is where you can create as many RPC function endpoints as you want! They just have the following format:

```
from mythic_c2_container.C2ProfileBase import *
import sys

# request is a dictionary: {"action": func_name, "message": "the input",  "task_id": task id num}
# must return an RPCResponse() object and set .status to an instance of RPCStatus and response to str of message
async def test(request):
    response = RPCResponse()
    response.status = RPCStatus.Success
    response.response = "hello"
    return response
```
