## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language that allows you, the user, to ask for very specific pieces of information from the database.
Whereas REST might have you hit 3-4 different endpoints to get all the data you need, GraphQL has you construct the query to get it all in one go.

All requests are POST requests to a single endpoint that are then processed by a local [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) docker container.
To determine what it is you're trying to do, GraphQL has a leading action of `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription` in each message.

## Authentication

Authentication is via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and Mythic's API tokens. To use a JWT just specify in the headers:
<CodeGroup>
    ```json Header
    Authorization: Bearer {token value}
    ```
    ```json API Token
    apitoken: {tokenvalue}
    ```
</CodeGroup>
