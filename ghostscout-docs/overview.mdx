## Detection Considerations

<Warning>
  Ghost Scout activities can be detected by security monitoring and rate limiting
</Warning>

### Detection Indicators

**API Activity:**
- Hunter.io API queries for target domain
- Patterns of email address enumeration
- Bulk contact lookups
- Rapid sequential API requests

**Network Activity:**
- Web scraping of public profiles
- Systematic URL enumeration
- Connections to MarkItDown-API service
- High volume of HTTP requests to target-related sites

**Hunter.io Alerts:**
- Hunter.io may notify organizations when their domain is searched
- Target companies may receive alerts about email searches
- API usage patterns may trigger rate limiting

### OPSEC Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Usage" icon="plug">
    - Use dedicated Hunter.io accounts for operations
    - Be aware that searches may alert target organizations
    - Consider rate limiting to avoid detection
    - Rotate API keys if performing multiple campaigns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Web Scraping" icon="spider-web">
    - Respect robots.txt and rate limits
    - Use appropriate user agents
    - Space out requests to avoid detection
    - Consider using proxies for source scraping
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Storage" icon="database">
    - SQLite database contains all reconnaissance data
    - Secure database files appropriately
    - Consider encryption for sensitive campaign data
    - Regularly clean up old campaign data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infrastructure" icon="server">
    - Redis contains job queue data
    - Secure Redis instance appropriately
    - Consider isolated infrastructure for campaigns
    - Use separate instances per client/campaign
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Defensive Recommendations

<Accordion title="Detection Strategies">
  **For Blue Teams:**

  - Monitor for Hunter.io searches of your domain (they provide alerts)
  - Watch for systematic enumeration of employee emails
  - Track unusual patterns of social media profile views
  - Alert on bulk scraping of public employee profiles
  - Monitor for AI-generated phishing patterns (unusual personalization)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prevention Strategies">
  **For Organizations:**

  - Limit publicly available employee information
  - Train users to recognize personalized phishing attempts
  - Implement email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
  - Use email security gateways with AI detection
  - Monitor for reconnaissance activities via Hunter.io
  - Educate employees about OSINT risks
  - Consider limiting public employee directories
</Accordion>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Be aware of the following limitations when using Ghost Scout
</Warning>
