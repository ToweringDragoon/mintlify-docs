## Getting Started

After [installing Ghost Scout](/ghost_scout-mdx/installation), you can begin your reconnaissance workflow. The application provides a web interface accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Typical Workflow

Ghost Scout follows a sequential workflow for building phishing campaigns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Target Domain">
    Navigate to the Domains page and add your target company's domain

    - Enter the domain (e.g., `example.com`)
    - Ghost Scout will store the domain and prepare for reconnaissance
    - DNS records will be queued for lookup
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Reconnaissance">
    Initiate Hunter.io search to find employees and email formats

    - Click "Start Reconnaissance" for the target domain
    - Hunter.io API will search for email addresses
    - Email format patterns will be identified
    - Discovered contacts will be stored in the database
    - Real-time updates will show progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scrape Sources">
    Enrich contact information by scraping discovered URLs

    - Review discovered sources for each contact
    - Select sources to scrape for additional information
    - HTML content will be converted to Markdown
    - Source data will be associated with contacts
    - Enriched profiles will include scraped content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Profiles">
    Use AI to generate detailed profiles for discovered contacts

    - Select contacts for profile generation
    - Anthropic API will analyze scraped data
    - AI will generate structured profiles
    - Profiles include key information and context
    - Review generated profiles for accuracy
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Pretexts">
    Generate personalized phishing emails for each target

    - Select targets for pretext generation
    - Choose prompt template from library
    - AI generates personalized pretexts
    - Review generated emails for quality
    - Edit pretexts as needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review & Export">
    Review, approve, and export pretexts for your campaign

    - Review all generated pretexts
    - Make final edits and approvals
    - Export for use in phishing infrastructure
    - Track which pretexts have been used
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Feature Usage

### Domain Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Domain">
    **Adding a Target Domain:**

    1. Navigate to the Domains page
    2. Click "Add Domain"
    3. Enter the target domain (without `http://` or `www`)
    4. Click "Submit"

    **Example:**
    ```
    Domain: targetcompany.com
    ```

    Ghost Scout will:
    - Store the domain in the database
    - Queue DNS lookups (MX, SPF, DMARC records)
    - Prepare for reconnaissance activities
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="View DNS Records">
    **Viewing DNS Information:**

    After adding a domain, view DNS records:
    - **MX Records**: Mail server information
    - **SPF Records**: Email authentication policies
    - **DMARC Records**: Email security policies

    This information helps understand email infrastructure and security posture.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Related Domains">
    **Autodiscovery:**

    Ghost Scout can discover related domains:
    - Autodiscover records
    - Mail server domains
    - Related organizational domains

    Use this to expand your reconnaissance scope.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reconnaissance

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start Reconnaissance">
    **Initiating Hunter.io Search:**

    1. Select a domain from your list
    2. Click "Start Reconnaissance"
    3. Monitor real-time progress updates

    **What Happens:**
    - Hunter.io API searches for email addresses at the domain
    - Email format patterns are identified (e.g., `{first}.{last}@domain.com`)
    - Discovered contacts are stored with available information
    - Sources (LinkedIn, company websites, etc.) are recorded
    - Real-time updates show discovered contacts
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monitor Progress">
    **Real-time Updates:**

    Watch Socket.io updates for:
    - Number of contacts discovered
    - Email format patterns identified
    - Sources found for each contact
    - Job queue progress
    - Completion status

    Progress is shown in real-time without page refreshes.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Review Contacts">
    **Analyzing Discovered Contacts:**

    For each contact, view:
    - Name and email address
    - Position/role (if available)
    - Sources where information was found
    - Confidence score
    - Associated domain

    Use this information to prioritize targets.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Source Scraping

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Select Sources">
    **Choosing Sources to Scrape:**

    1. Navigate to a contact's detail page
    2. Review discovered sources (URLs)
    3. Select sources likely to contain useful information
    4. Click "Scrape Selected"

    **Source Types:**
    - LinkedIn profiles
    - Company bios
    - Blog posts
    - Social media profiles
    - Company directories
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Scraping Process">
    **How Scraping Works:**

    1. Ghost Scout fetches the HTML content
    2. Content is sent to MarkItDown-API
    3. HTML is converted to clean Markdown
    4. Markdown is stored and associated with the contact
    5. Real-time updates show scraping progress

    **Benefits of Markdown:**
    - Better formatting for LLM processing
    - Cleaner data extraction
    - Improved profile generation quality
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Review Scraped Data">
    **Analyzing Source Data:**

    View scraped content for each source:
    - Original URL
    - Scraped date
    - Markdown content
    - Associated targets

    Use this to verify information quality before profile generation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Profile Generation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate Profiles">
    **Creating AI Profiles:**
