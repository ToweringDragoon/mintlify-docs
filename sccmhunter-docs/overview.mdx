SCCMHunter is a post-exploitation tool built to streamline identifying, profiling, and attacking SCCM-related assets in an Active Directory domain. This comprehensive toolkit provides multiple attack vectors against Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) infrastructure.

<Info>
SCCMHunter was developed and tested in lab environments. Performance may vary in production networks. Please report issues on GitHub if you encounter problems.

## Attack Methodology

SCCMHunter follows a systematic approach to SCCM exploitation:

### 1. **Discovery and Enumeration**
The tool queries LDAP through multiple methods to identify SCCM infrastructure:

<Accordion title="Schema Extension Discovery">
Checks the DACL for the 'System Management' container manually created during AD schema extension
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Management Point Resolution">
Resolves any published Management Points that clients use for communication
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deployment Services Detection">
Identifies PXE-enabled Distribution Points using Windows Deployment Services
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Naming Convention Search">
Searches for "SCCM" and "MECM" keywords throughout the directory based on common naming practices
</Accordion>

### 2. **Target Profiling**
Once targets are identified, SCCMHunter profiles them using the SMB module:

- **Share Analysis**: Checks for default shares required by specific SCCM roles
- **SMB Signing Status**: Determines SMB signing configuration for potential relay attacks
- **Service Detection**: Identifies MSSQL services and SMS Provider roles
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Builds a comprehensive picture of potential attack paths

### 3. **Exploitation Modules**

## Tool Capabilities

<Card title="Comprehensive SCCM Assessment" icon="chart-network">
SCCMHunter provides end-to-end capabilities for SCCM security assessment:

- **Automated Discovery**: LDAP-based enumeration of SCCM infrastructure
- **Intelligent Profiling**: SMB-based service and role identification
- **Multiple Attack Vectors**: HTTP, MSSQL, and DPAPI exploitation techniques
- **Post-Exploitation**: Administrative access and lateral movement capabilities

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
SCCMHunter requires existing network access and should only be used in authorized penetration testing scenarios.
</Warning>

- Valid Active Directory credentials
- Network access to target SCCM infrastructure
- Python 3.x environment
- Understanding of SCCM architecture and security implications
