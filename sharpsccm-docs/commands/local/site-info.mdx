## Overview

Get the current management point and site code for the local host via WMI. This command provides essential SCCM site configuration information that is fundamental for most other SharpSCCM operations.

## Syntax

```bash
SharpSCCM local site-info [options]
```

## Parameters

This command requires no additional parameters beyond the standard debug and help options.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Usage
# Get current management point and site code
SharpSCCM local site-info
```
</CodeGroup>

## Output Format

The command outputs current site configuration:

```text
[+] Connecting to \\127.0.0.1\root\CCM
[+] Executing WQL query: SELECT Name,CurrentManagementPoint FROM SMS_Authority
-----------------------------------
SMS_Authority
-----------------------------------
CurrentManagementPoint: ATLAS.APERTURE.SCI
Name: SMS:PS1
-----------------------------------
```

## Output Components

<Accordion title="Management Point">
  - **FQDN or NetBIOS name** of the primary management point
  - **Primary contact** for SCCM client communications
  - **Entry point** for most SCCM operations and reconnaissance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Site Code">
  - **Three-character identifier** for the SCCM site
  - **Required parameter** for most SharpSCCM commands
  - **Hierarchical identifier** in multi-site environments
</Accordion>

## Site Information Analysis

<Accordion title="Site Code Format">
  Site codes follow specific patterns:
  - **Primary Sites**: Usually alphanumeric (PS1, CAS, P01)
  - **Secondary Sites**: Inherit from parent primary site
  - **Central Administration**: Often use CAS or similar identifiers
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Management Point Role">
  The management point serves as:
  - **Policy distribution point** for client configurations
  - **Inventory collection point** for hardware/software data
  - **Client communication hub** for status reporting
  - **Authentication gateway** for client operations
</Accordion>

## Common Use Cases

<Accordion title="Initial Reconnaissance">
  First command to run when discovering SCCM infrastructure - provides essential targeting information for subsequent operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-Site Environments">
  Identify which site the current client belongs to in complex SCCM hierarchies with multiple sites.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Parameter Discovery">
  Obtain the management point and site code values required for other SharpSCCM commands targeting remote operations.
</Accordion>

## Integration with Other Commands

Most SharpSCCM commands require the management point and site code discovered by this command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using Discovered Values
# After running site-info and finding MP: ATLAS.APERTURE.SCI, Site: PS1

# Use in remote operations
SharpSCCM get collections -mp ATLAS.APERTURE.SCI -sc PS1

# Use in credential operations
SharpSCCM get naa -mp ATLAS.APERTURE.SCI -sc PS1

# Use in enumeration
SharpSCCM get devices -mp ATLAS.APERTURE.SCI -sc PS1
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="No Site Information">
  If no site information is returned:
  - SCCM client may not be properly installed
  - Client may not be assigned to a site
  - WMI repository may be corrupted
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Management Points">
  In some configurations, clients may have multiple management points configured for redundancy. This command shows the current active one.
</Accordion>

## Security Considerations

<Info>
  The management point information revealed by this command:
  - Identifies key SCCM infrastructure for targeting
  - Provides entry points for further reconnaissance
  - May reveal internal network topology and naming conventions
