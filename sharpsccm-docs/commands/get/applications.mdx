## Overview

Enumerate applications available in SCCM. Applications represent software packages that can be deployed to collections, making them potential attack vectors for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

## Syntax

```bash
SharpSCCM get applications [options]
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="sms-provider" type="string">
  The IP address, FQDN, or NetBIOS name of the SMS Provider to connect to
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="site-code" type="string">
  The three-character site code (e.g., "PS1")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  Filter applications by name pattern (supports partial matching)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="properties" type="string">
  Specify properties to retrieve (can be used multiple times)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="where-condition" type="string">
  Custom WQL WHERE clause for advanced filtering
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count" type="boolean">
  Return count of results only
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="verbose" type="boolean">
  Display all application properties
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Usage
# List all applications
SharpSCCM get applications -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Count applications
SharpSCCM get applications -c -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

```bash Application Search
# Find specific applications
SharpSCCM get applications -n "Office" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Find PowerShell applications
SharpSCCM get applications -n "PowerShell" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

```bash Security Analysis
# Find hidden applications
SharpSCCM get applications -w "IsHidden = True" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Applications running as SYSTEM
SharpSCCM get applications -w "ExecutionContext = 0" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Recently created applications
SharpSCCM get applications -w "DateCreated > '2023-01-01'" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

## Security Analysis

<Accordion title="High-Risk Applications">
  **System Context Applications (ExecutionContext = 0):**
  - Run with SYSTEM privileges
  - Potential privilege escalation vectors
  - High impact for lateral movement

  **Hidden Applications (IsHidden = True):**
  - Not visible in Software Center
  - Often administrative or testing applications
  - May contain sensitive functionality

  **Recently Created Applications:**
  - New applications may have weak security
  - Testing applications with elevated privileges
  - Recently added attack tools
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Attack Vector Analysis">
  **Privilege Escalation:**
  - System context applications for privilege escalation
  - Applications with excessive permissions
  - Custom applications with security flaws
