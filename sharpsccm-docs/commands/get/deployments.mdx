## Overview

Analyze application deployment assignments to understand how applications are distributed across the environment. Deployments reveal targeting strategies, security implications, and potential attack opportunities.

## Syntax

```bash
SharpSCCM get deployments [options]
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="sms-provider" type="string">
  The IP address, FQDN, or NetBIOS name of the SMS Provider to connect to
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="site-code" type="string">
  The three-character site code (e.g., "PS1")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  Filter deployments by application name (supports partial matching)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="collection" type="string">
  Filter by target collection name
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="properties" type="string">
  Specify properties to retrieve (can be used multiple times)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="where-condition" type="string">
  Custom WQL WHERE clause for advanced filtering
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count" type="boolean">
  Return count of results only
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="verbose" type="boolean">
  Display all deployment properties
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Usage
# List all deployments
SharpSCCM get deployments -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Count total deployments
SharpSCCM get deployments -c -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

```bash Deployment Analysis
# Find deployments for specific application
SharpSCCM get deployments -n "PowerShell" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Find deployments to specific collection
SharpSCCM get deployments -collection "Admin Workstations" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

```bash Security Analysis
# Required deployments (forced installation)
SharpSCCM get deployments -w "DeploymentIntent = 1" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Available deployments (user choice)
SharpSCCM get deployments -w "DeploymentIntent = 2" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1

# Deployments with no user interaction
SharpSCCM get deployments -w "RequireUserInteraction = False" -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

## Deployment Analysis

<Accordion title="Deployment Types">
  **Required Deployments (DeploymentIntent = 1):**
  - Forced installation on target systems
  - No user choice or intervention
  - Automatic execution based on schedule

  **Available Deployments (DeploymentIntent = 2):**
  - User can choose to install
  - Visible in Software Center
  - User-initiated installation

  **Install vs Uninstall:**
  - Install deployments add software
  - Uninstall deployments remove software
  - Supersedence deployments replace software
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Implications">
  **High-Risk Deployments:**
  - Required deployments with no user interaction
  - Deployments that override service windows
  - Deployments with forced reboots
  - Deployments to administrative collections

  **Stealth Deployments:**
  - Silent installations (RequireUserInteraction = False)
  - Outside maintenance windows
  - Immediate execution deployments
</Accordion>

## Attack Opportunities

<Accordion title="Deployment Abuse">
  **Malicious Application Deployment:**
  - Deploy malicious applications to target collections
  - Use required deployments for forced execution
  - Target administrative collections for privilege escalation

  **Legitimate Application Abuse:**
  - Abuse existing deployments for lateral movement
  - Modify deployment settings for stealth execution
  - Use application supersedence for payload delivery
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collection Targeting">
  **High-Value Targets:**
  - Administrative workstation collections
  - Server collections
  - Critical infrastructure collections

  **Broad Impact:**
  - All Systems collection for maximum reach
  - Domain computer collections for lateral movement
  - User collections for credential harvesting
</Accordion>

## Intelligence Gathering

<Accordion title="Organizational Patterns">
  **Deployment Strategies:**
  - Pilot groups for testing
  - Phased rollouts across collections
  - Emergency deployments for critical updates

  **Administrative Practices:**
  - Service window usage and overrides
  - User interaction requirements
  - Reboot and maintenance policies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Analysis">
  **Risk Assessment:**
  - Required deployments with broad targeting
  - Silent installations without user notification
  - Deployments to privileged collections
  - Applications with system-level execution
</Accordion>

## Common Queries

<CodeGroup>
```sql Required Deployments
DeploymentIntent = 1
```

```sql Silent Installations
RequireUserInteraction = False
```

```sql Service Window Overrides
OverrideServiceWindows = True
```

```sql Immediate Deployments
DeploymentTime <= GETDATE()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Attack Vector Analysis">
  **Deployment Mechanisms:**
  - Identify deployment patterns and schedules
  - Understand collection targeting strategies
  - Analyze security configurations and overrides

  **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Target deployments to administrative collections
  - Abuse system-context applications
  - Exploit forced deployment mechanisms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Lateral Movement Planning">
  **Collection Analysis:**
  - Identify broad-reaching collections
  - Target specific organizational groups
  - Exploit existing deployment relationships

  **Timing and Stealth:**
  - Use service windows for stealth
  - Plan deployments during maintenance windows
  - Avoid user interaction and notification
</Accordion>

## Output Analysis

<Accordion title="Deployment Patterns">
  **By Intent:**
  - Required: Administrative control and compliance
  - Available: User choice and self-service

  **By Scope:**
  - Broad deployments: Organization-wide software
  - Targeted deployments: Role or group-specific software
  - Test deployments: Pilot or staging deployments

  **By Timing:**
  - Scheduled: Planned deployment windows
  - Immediate: Emergency or critical deployments
  - Recurring: Ongoing or maintenance deployments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Considerations">
  **High-Risk Deployments:**
  - Required + Silent + Administrative collections
  - System context + Broad targeting
  - Service window overrides + Forced reboots

  **Attack Indicators:**
  - Unusual deployment patterns
  - New deployments to administrative collections
  - Silent deployments of unknown applications
</Accordion>
