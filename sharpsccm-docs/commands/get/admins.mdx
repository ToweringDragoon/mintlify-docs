## Security Role Analysis

<Accordion title="High-Privilege Roles">
  **Full Administrator:**
  - Complete SCCM control and access
  - All permissions across all objects
  - Highest privilege level

  **Infrastructure Administrator:**
  - Site and system management
  - Site server configuration
  - Distribution point management
  - SQL Server access often required

  **Application Administrator:**
  - Application deployment control
  - Package and program management
  - Software library access
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Specialized Roles">
  **Operating System Deployment Manager:**
  - OS deployment and imaging
  - Boot image management
  - Task sequence creation
  - Often requires domain admin rights

  **Software Update Manager:**
  - Software update deployment
  - Update group management
  - WSUS integration

  **Security Administrator:**
  - Security role management
  - Administrative user creation
  - Permission boundary control
</Accordion>

## Attack Vector Analysis

<Accordion title="Privilege Escalation Paths">
  **Target High-Privilege Administrators:**
  - Full Administrators for complete SCCM control
  - Infrastructure Administrators for site access
  - Application Administrators for deployment abuse

  **Role-Based Attacks:**
  - Compromise admin accounts for role inheritance
  - Exploit role permissions for lateral movement
  - Abuse deployment capabilities for code execution
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Administrative Scope">
  **Account Types:**
  - **User accounts (AccountType = 0):** Individual administrator access
  - **Group accounts (AccountType = 1):** Inherited group permissions

  **Targeting Strategies:**
  - Individual accounts for direct compromise
  - Group accounts for broader access
  - Service accounts for persistent access
</Accordion>

## Intelligence Gathering

<Accordion title="Administrative Structure">
  Administrator enumeration reveals:
  - **Organizational hierarchy** and responsibilities
  - **Administrative boundaries** and delegation
  - **Service account usage** patterns
  - **Group-based administration** models
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account Analysis">
  **Naming Patterns:**
  - Service accounts: svc_sccm, sccmservice
  - Administrative accounts: sccmadmin, admin_sccm
  - Personal accounts: firstname.lastname
  - Shared accounts: shared_admin, team_admin

  **Creation Dates:**
  - Recent accounts may indicate changes
  - Old accounts may have accumulated privileges
  - Bulk creation may indicate automation
</Accordion>

## Common Queries

<CodeGroup>
```sql Full Administrators
RoleNames LIKE '%Full Administrator%'
```

```sql User Accounts Only
AccountType = 0
```

```sql Recently Created
CreatedDate > '2023-01-01'
```

```sql Service Accounts
LogonName LIKE '%svc%' OR LogonName LIKE '%service%'
```

```sql Domain Groups
AccountType = 1 AND LogonName LIKE 'DOMAIN\%'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Operational Use Cases

<Accordion title="Target Identification">
  **High-Value Targets:**
  - Full Administrators for complete access
  - Infrastructure Administrators for site control
  - Recently created accounts for weak passwords
  - Service accounts for persistence
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Privilege Mapping">
  **Administrative Relationships:**
  - Map role assignments to understand privileges
  - Identify overlapping administrative access
  - Find potential privilege escalation paths
  - Understand administrative boundaries
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Attack Planning">
  **Credential Targeting:**
  - Focus on high-privilege accounts
  - Target accounts with broad role assignments
  - Identify shared or service accounts
  - Find accounts with infrastructure access
</Accordion>

## Output Analysis

<Accordion title="Role Distribution">
  Common role assignments:
  - **Multiple roles:** Users with several role assignments
  - **Broad permissions:** Full Administrator assignments
  - **Specialized access:** Single-purpose role assignments
  - **Group inheritance:** Permissions via group membership
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account Patterns">
  Administrative patterns indicate:
  - **Centralized administration:** Few high-privilege accounts
