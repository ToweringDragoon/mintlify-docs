## Overview

Retrieve information about SCCM sites by querying Active Directory via LDAP. This command identifies potential site servers by examining permissions on the System Management container.

## Syntax

```bash
SharpSCCM get site-info [options]
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="domain" type="string">
  Target Active Directory domain FQDN
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Usage
# Discover site servers in current domain
SharpSCCM get site-info
```

```bash Specify Domain
# Target specific domain
SharpSCCM get site-info -d corp.local
```

```bash Debug Mode
# Include debug information for troubleshooting
SharpSCCM get site-info -d corp.local --debug
```
</CodeGroup>

## Required Permissions

<Info>
  **Domain\Authenticated Users** - Standard LDAP read access to Active Directory
</Info>

## Technical Details

<Accordion title="Detection Method">
  This command queries LDAP for computer accounts with **GenericAll (Full Control)** permissions on the System Management container in Active Directory. Systems with this permission are typically SCCM site servers, as they need these rights to manage the container.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Detection Points">
  Security teams can monitor for:
  - LDAP queries to domain controllers
  - Enumeration of System Management container permissions
  - Computer account privilege analysis
  - Queries for `CN=System Management,CN=System,DC=domain,DC=com`
</Accordion>

## Output Format

The command identifies computer accounts with elevated permissions:

```text
[!] Found 2 computer account(s) with GenericAll permission on the System Management container:

      CORP\SCCM01$
      CORP\CAS01$

[+] These systems are likely to be ConfigMgr site servers
```

## Analysis and Next Steps

<Accordion title="Site Server Identification">
  Computer accounts with GenericAll permissions are strong indicators of:
  - **Primary site servers** hosting SMS Provider role
  - **Central Administration Sites** (CAS) in hierarchies
  - **Secondary site servers** in some configurations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Infrastructure Mapping">
  Use the identified servers for:
  - SMS Provider connections for WMI operations
  - Management point identification
  - Site hierarchy mapping
  - Network topology understanding
</Accordion>

## Common Use Cases

<Accordion title="Initial Reconnaissance">
  First command to run when discovering SCCM infrastructure in a domain - provides entry points for further enumeration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Site Hierarchy Discovery">
  In multi-site environments, identify all site servers and understand the organizational structure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Attack Surface Analysis">
  Discover SCCM infrastructure components for security assessment and penetration testing.
</Accordion>

## Integration with Other Commands

Use discovered site servers with other SharpSCCM commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash SMS Provider Operations
# Use discovered site server as SMS Provider
SharpSCCM get collections -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```

```bash Management Point Discovery
# Connect to site server to enumerate management points
SharpSCCM get devices -sms SCCM01.corp.local -sc PS1
```
</CodeGroup>
