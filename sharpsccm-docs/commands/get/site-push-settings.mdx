## Overview

Analyze automatic client push installation settings from the SMS Provider. This reveals security-relevant configuration including push accounts and authentication settings.

<Warning>
  **Security Impact**: Client push accounts often have administrative privileges across the domain. Identifying these accounts can reveal high-value targets for credential attacks.
</Warning>
