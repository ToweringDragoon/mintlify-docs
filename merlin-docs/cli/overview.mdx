Merlin is composed of the following components:

- **Merlin Server** - The program that receives and handles Agent traffic and operator CLI commands to control the server and Agents
- **Merlin Agent** - The post-exploitation command and control Agent that runs on a compromised host
- **Merlin CLI** - The command line interface that allows operators to interact with the Merlin Server and Agents

<Note>
This page covers the Merlin Command Line Interface (CLI) program
</Note>

The CLI uses Google RPC (gRPC) protocol buffers over TLS to communicate with the Merlin Server.
All API calls require a password to authenticate to the server.

## Command Line Flags

```text
$ ./merlin-cli -h
Usage of merlin-cli:
  -addr string
        The address of the Merlin server to connect to (default "127.0.0.1:50051")
  -password string
        the password to connect to the Merlin server (default "merlin")
  -secure
        Require server TLS certificate verification
  -tlsCA string
        TLS Certificate Authority file path
  -tlsCert string
        TLS certificate file path
  -tlsKey string
        TLS private key file path
  -version
        Print the version number and exit
```

### addr

<Note>
The default address is `127.0.0.1:50051`
</Note>

The `addr` flag specifies the address of the Merlin Server to connect to. The connection uses gRPC over TLS.

### password

<Warning>
The default password is `merlin` and should always be changed to prevent unauthorized access
</Warning>

The `password` flag sets the password needed to authenticate all gRPC requests.

### secure

<Note>
By default, the Merlin Server will generate a self-signed TLS certificate that will not be trusted by the CLI if this flag is enabled.
</Note>

The `secure` flag enables TLS certificate verification. When this flag is set, the CLI will verify the Server's TLS certificate.

### tlsCA

The `tlsCA` flag specifies a custom CA certificate file to validate and trust the Server's certificate.

### tlsCert

The `tlsCert` flag specifies the certificate file the Merlin CLI will use for mutual TLS authentication with the Merlin Server.

### tlsKey

The `tlsKey` flag specifies the private key file for the `tlsCert`.

### version

The `version` flag prints the version number of the Merlin Server and exits.

```text
$ ./merlin-cli -version
Merlin Version: 1.0.0, Build: nonRelease
```
