HTTP/3 is the combination of HTTP/2 over the Quick UDP Internet Connections
(QUIC) protocol. This tool was the result of my work evaluating HTTP/2 in a paper titled
[Practical Approach to Detecting and Preventing Web Application Attacks over HTTP/2](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/protocols/practical-approach-detecting-preventing-web-application-attacks-http-2-36877/).
