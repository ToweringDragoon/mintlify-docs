## Overview

The `jira listusers` command enumerates all Atlassian users accessible in a Jira instance, providing email addresses, display names, account IDs, and account status. This reconnaissance command is critical for user enumeration, building target lists for phishing campaigns, obtaining user IDs for @mentions in issues and comments, and mapping organizational structure.

## Syntax

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listusers [options]
```

## Required Parameters

<ParamField path="--url" type="string" required>
  The base URL of the target Jira instance (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
</ParamField>

## Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="--cookie" type="string">
  Authentication cookie (`cloud.session.token` or `tenant.session.token`). Required for accessing user information in most instances
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--full" type="boolean" default="false">
  Return comprehensive user information including display name, user ID, and active status. When false, only displays email addresses
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output" type="string">
  Save command output to a specified file
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic User Enumeration

List all users with email addresses only:

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listusers \
  --url https://company.atlassian.net \
  --cookie $cookie
```

### Comprehensive User Information

List all users with full details:

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listusers \
  --url https://company.atlassian.net \
  --full \
  --cookie $cookie
```

### Save User List to File

Export user listing for offline analysis:

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listusers \
  --url https://company.atlassian.net \
  --full \
  --output jira_users.txt \
  --cookie $cookie
```

### Build Phishing Target List

Extract email addresses for phishing campaign:

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listusers \
  --url https://company.atlassian.net \
  --output phishing_targets.txt \
  --cookie $cookie
```

    - **Phishing Target Lists**: Build email lists for phishing and social engineering campaigns
    - **User ID Collection**: Obtain account IDs for @mentions in `createissue` and `addcomment` attacks
    - **Organizational Mapping**: Understand company structure through email domains and naming conventions
    - **Password Spraying**: Generate username lists for password spraying attacks
    - **Social Engineering**: Identify high-value targets based on email patterns (executives, admins)
    - **Credential Validation**: Verify compromised credentials against known user list
    - **Active User Detection**: Identify active users for targeted attacks (using `--full`)
    - **Email Pattern Discovery**: Learn organizational email format for generating additional targets

    ### Defensive Monitoring

    - **User Access Audit**: Verify who has access to the Jira instance
    - **Deactivation Review**: Identify accounts that should be deactivated
    - **External User Detection**: Find external or contractor accounts
    - **Compliance Auditing**: Ensure user accounts comply with security policies
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor for suspicious user enumeration activity
    - **Incident Response**: Investigate user enumeration during security events
    - **Access Control Validation**: Verify appropriate user access levels
    - **Security Awareness**: Understand attack surface from user enumeration perspective

## Output

### Default Output (Email Only)

When `--full` is not specified, returns sorted email addresses:

```
User Email: admin@company.com

User Email: alice.smith@company.com

User Email: bob.jones@company.com

User Email: charlie.wilson@company.com
```

### Full Output (With --full Flag)

When `--full` is specified, returns comprehensive user information:

```
User Name : Alice Smith
User Id   : 5d9e8c7f2a3b1c0d4e5f6789
Active    : True
User Email: alice.smith@company.com

User Name : Bob Jones
User Id   : 6e0f9d8g3b4c2d1e5f6g7890
Active    : True
User Email: bob.jones@company.com

User Name : Charlie Wilson (Deactivated)
User Id   : 7f1g0e9h4c5d3e2f6g7h8901
Active    : False
User Email: charlie.wilson@company.com
```

### Output Information

Basic mode:
- **User Email**: Email address of each user (sorted alphabetically)

Full mode (`--full`):
- **User Name**: Display name of the user
- **User Id**: Atlassian account ID (use this for @mentions with `--at` parameter)
- **Active**: Whether the account is currently active (True/False)
- **User Email**: Email address

## Detection Considerations

<Warning>
**Detection Indicators**

Security teams should monitor for:

- User enumeration requests to `/rest/api/3/users/search`
- Large numbers of paginated user listing requests (200 users per page)
- User enumeration from unusual IP addresses or geographic locations
- User listing outside normal business hours
- Enumeration from accounts that don't typically access Jira
- Anonymous user enumeration attempts
- Correlation with subsequent phishing campaigns targeting listed users
- Correlation with password spraying attacks
- User listing shortly after credential compromise
- Repeated user listing requests (reconnaissance activity)
</Warning>

### Jira Audit Log Entries

This command generates the following audit log events:
- User search/enumeration operations may be logged
- API access to user endpoints
- Includes: User ID (requester), timestamp, IP address, user agent

### Network Indicators

- HTTP GET requests to `/rest/api/3/users/search?maxResults=200&startAt={offset}`
- Multiple sequential requests (increments of 200) until all users are retrieved
- Pattern: startAt=0, startAt=200, startAt=400, etc.
- Large response sizes containing user data

## OPSEC Considerations

<Tip>
**Operational Security Tips**

To reduce detection risk when using this command:

1. **Timing**: Execute during business hours when legitimate Jira access is common
2. **Single Execution**: Only enumerate users once and save results (use `--output`)
3. **Account Context**: Use cookies from accounts that may legitimately need user information
4. **Rate Limiting**: The tool automatically paginates; be aware this generates multiple requests
5. **Delayed Use**: Don't immediately use enumerated data (space out phishing/spraying attacks)
6. **IP Considerations**: Be aware of geographic IP inconsistencies
7. **Correlation Prevention**: Avoid enumerating users immediately before phishing campaigns
8. **Anonymous Restrictions**: Anonymous user enumeration typically disabled or very limited
9. **Data Handling**: Securely handle exported user lists containing PII
10. **Operational Use**: Use enumerated data judiciously to avoid pattern detection
</Tip>

### Enumeration Behavior

- The tool automatically paginates through all users in batches of 200
- Enumeration continues until fewer than 200 users are returned (indicating the last page)
- Output is sorted alphabetically by email address for easier analysis
- Users without email addresses are excluded from results

### User ID Usage

User IDs obtained with `--full` can be used with:
- `jira createissue --at {userId}` - Mention user in new issues
- `jira addcomment --at {userId}` - Mention user in comments

Example user ID: `5d9e8c7f2a3b1c0d4e5f6789`

## Related Commands

- [jira createissue](/jira/createissue) - Create issues with user mentions (use `--at` with user IDs from this command)
- [jira addcomment](/jira/addcomment) - Add comments with user mentions (use `--at` with user IDs)
- [jira listprojects](/jira/listprojects) - List projects to understand organizational structure
- [jira listissues](/jira/listissues) - List issues showing creator and assignee information
