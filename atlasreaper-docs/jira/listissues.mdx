## Overview

The `jira listissues` command enumerates issues within Jira projects, providing detailed information about issue content, creators, assignees, status, and optionally comments and attachments. This reconnaissance command is essential for understanding organizational structure, identifying active projects, discovering sensitive information, and planning targeted attacks or data exfiltration operations.

## Syntax

```bash
.\AtlasReaper.exe jira listissues [options]
```

## Required Parameters

<ParamField path="--url" type="string" required>
  The base URL of the target Jira instance (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
</ParamField>

## Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="--cookie" type="string">
  Authentication cookie (`cloud.session.token` or `tenant.session.token`). Required for accessing non-public issues
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--project" type="string">
  Project key or ID to list issues from (e.g., `PROJ`, `12345`). If not specified, lists issues across all accessible projects
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--issue" type="string">
  Specific issue key to retrieve (e.g., `PROJ-123`). Use this to get detailed information about a single issue
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--all" type="boolean" default="false">
  Return all issues (not just the first 100). Automatically paginates through all results in batches of 100
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--limit" type="string" default="100">
  Maximum number of issues to return (when not using `--all`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--comments" type="boolean" default="false">
  Include comments in the issue output. Useful for discovering internal communications and potential sensitive information
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--attachments" type="boolean" default="false">
  Include attachment information in the issue output. Shows filenames and attachment IDs
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output" type="string">
  Save command output to a specified file
</ParamField>

## Detection Considerations

<Warning>
**Detection Indicators**

Security teams should monitor for:

- Use of `--all` flag (comprehensive enumeration)
- Large numbers of issue listings in short timeframes
- Access to projects outside user's normal scope
- Issue viewing patterns from unusual IP addresses or locations
- Listing activity outside normal business hours
- Sequential issue enumeration (PROJ-1, PROJ-2, PROJ-3, ...)
- Correlation with subsequent download or comment activity
- Service accounts performing bulk issue queries
- Listing activity after credential compromise indicators
- Requests including `--comments` and `--attachments` flags (deep reconnaissance)
</Warning>

### Jira Audit Log Entries

This command generates the following audit log events:
- `issue_viewed` - Logged for each issue accessed
- Search/query operations may be logged
- Includes: User ID, issue key, project key, timestamp, IP address

### Network Indicators

- HTTP GET requests to `/rest/api/3/search?jql=...&expand=renderedFields&fields=...`
- JQL queries with project or issue filters
- Multiple sequential requests when using `--all` (pagination)
- Query parameters indicating comment and attachment inclusion
- Large response sizes when retrieving many issues with full details

## OPSEC Considerations

<Tip>
**Operational Security Tips**

To reduce detection risk when using this command:

1. **Targeted Queries**: Use `--project` to limit scope rather than querying all accessible issues
2. **Rate Limiting**: Use `--limit` to retrieve smaller batches over time
3. **Timing**: Execute during business hours when legitimate activity is high
4. **Selective Details**: Only include `--comments` and `--attachments` when necessary
5. **Output Files**: Save results to files for offline analysis to reduce repeated queries
6. **Account Context**: Use cookies from accounts that regularly access the target projects
7. **Incremental Approach**: Start with specific issues before expanding to full project listings
8. **Pagination Awareness**: Be aware that `--all` generates multiple API requests (one per 100 issues)
9. **Issue Selection**: Target active projects where queries blend with normal activity
10. **Network Bandwidth**: Large result sets may be noticeable in network monitoring
</Tip>

### Performance Considerations

- Using `--all` with `--comments` and `--attachments` can generate substantial data
- Each page of 100 issues requires a separate API request
- Large projects may take minutes to fully enumerate
- Network latency affects overall operation time

### Permission Considerations

- Users can only see issues in projects they have access to
- Issue-level security may restrict visibility of certain issues
- Anonymous access typically very limited or disabled
