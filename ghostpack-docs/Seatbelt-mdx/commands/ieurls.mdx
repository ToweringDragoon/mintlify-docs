## Overview

The `IEUrls` command enumerates Internet Explorer's typed URL history - URLs that users manually typed into the address bar. By default, it shows URLs from the last 7 days, but this can be customized. This provides insight into user browsing patterns and manually accessed resources.

**Important:** User commands run for the current user if not elevated and for ALL users if elevated.

## Syntax

```
Seatbelt.exe IEUrls
Seatbelt.exe "IEUrls [days]"
```

### Arguments

- **days**: Number of days to look back (default: 7)

## Output

The command returns:
- Typed URLs from IE address bar
- Timestamps of when URLs were typed
- URL patterns revealing user interests
- Internal and external web resources
- User context for each URL entry

## Output

The command supports remote execution (marked with + in the command list).

## Use Cases

## Detection Considerations

### Indicators
- Registry enumeration of TypedURLs keys
- Access to user registry hives (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs)
- Reading browser history data
- Enumeration across multiple user profiles

### Defensive Monitoring
- Monitor registry access to TypedURLs keys
- Alert on automated enumeration of browser history
- Track processes reading IE history data
- Log unusual access patterns to browser registry keys
- Detect reconnaissance tools querying typed URLs
- Monitor for bulk enumeration across multiple users

### What Typed URLs Reveal
- Direct access to admin interfaces suggests privileged users
- IP address typing indicates technical knowledge or internal systems
- VPN/remote access URLs show remote connectivity methods
- Internal application URLs reveal organizational infrastructure
- Pattern of manual URL entry suggests specific workflows
