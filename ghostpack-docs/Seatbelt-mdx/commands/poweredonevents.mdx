## Overview

The PoweredOnEvents command analyzes the System event log to build a timeline of system reboots and sleep/wake events. It examines specific Event IDs (1, 12, 13, 42, and 6008) to understand the system's power and availability schedule, which can inform attack timing and persistence strategies.

## Syntax

```bash
# Default: last 7 days
Seatbelt.exe PoweredOnEvents

# Specify number of days
Seatbelt.exe "PoweredOnEvents 30"
```

### Remote Execution
```bash
Seatbelt.exe PoweredOnEvents -computername=TARGET.domain.com [-username=DOMAIN\user -password=pass]
```

## Output

Returns power event timeline:
- Event timestamp
- Event type (Boot, Shutdown, Sleep, Wake)
- Event ID
- Event description

## Remote Execution

<Check>
This command **supports remote execution** using the `-computername` parameter.
</Check>

## Detection Considerations

<Info>
Low detection risk - reads Windows event logs.
</Info>

- **Event Log Access**: Queries System event log
- **Remote Access**: Generates event log query events when executed remotely
