## Performance Considerations

This command has minimal performance impact as it only reads registry values. Execution time depends on the number of installed products but is generally very fast, completing in seconds even on systems with many applications installed.

## Remote Execution

This command supports remote execution via WMI. Use the `-computername` parameter to enumerate installed products on remote systems:

```
Seatbelt.exe InstalledProducts -computername=TARGET.domain.com
Seatbelt.exe InstalledProducts -computername=WORKSTATION01 -username=DOMAIN\admin -password=Pass123
```

## Detection Considerations

### Indicators
- Registry access to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
- Registry access to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
- Registry access to `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
- WMI registry queries to remote systems
- Enumeration of registry subkeys under Uninstall paths

### Defensive Recommendations
- Monitor for mass registry enumeration operations
- Alert on registry access patterns consistent with reconnaissance
- Log registry access to software inventory keys
- Restrict remote WMI access to authorized accounts
- Implement least privilege for registry access
- Use AppLocker or similar to control execution of enumeration tools
- Track processes accessing software inventory registry keys
- Correlate software enumeration with other suspicious activity
