## Overview

The WifiProfile command enumerates saved WiFi profiles on the system and attempts to extract SSIDs, authentication types, and cleartext passwords/passphrases. This reveals previously connected wireless networks and their credentials, which can be valuable for gaining access to other networks or understanding the user's physical locations.

## Syntax

```bash
Seatbelt.exe WifiProfile
```

<Note>
This command does **not** support remote execution.
</Note>

## Output

Returns WiFi profile information:
- Profile name (SSID)
- Authentication type (WPA2-Personal, WPA2-Enterprise, etc.)
- Encryption type (AES, TKIP)
- Cleartext password/passphrase (if available)
- Auto-connect setting
- Connection mode

## Use Cases

## Example Output

```

[*] Enumerating saved WiFi profiles...

Profile Name         : CORP-WIRELESS

## Remote Execution

<Warning>
This command does **NOT support remote execution**.
</Warning>

WiFi profiles are stored locally in the system and require local access to extract.

## Detection Considerations

<Info>
Moderate detection risk - reads WiFi profile XML files.
</Info>

- **File Access**: Reads XML files from `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces\`
- **API Calls**: May use WLAN API functions
- **Privilege Requirements**: Requires administrator privileges to extract passwords
- **EDR Telemetry**: File access may be logged by security products

### Defensive Recommendations

- Monitor access to WiFi profile XML files
- Alert on bulk WiFi credential extraction
- Implement file integrity monitoring on profile directory
- Correlate with other credential theft indicators
