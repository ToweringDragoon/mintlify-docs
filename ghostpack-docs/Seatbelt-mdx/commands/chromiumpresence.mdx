## Overview

The `ChromiumPresence` command checks for the existence of interesting files associated with Chromium-based browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera. This command identifies the presence of browser data files without parsing their contents, providing a quick assessment of which browsers are installed and actively used.

**Important:** User commands run for the current user if not elevated and for ALL users if elevated.

## Syntax

```
Seatbelt.exe ChromiumPresence
```

No additional arguments are supported. This command supports remote execution.

## Output

The command returns:
- Presence of Chromium-based browser installations
- Locations of browser profile directories
- Existence of key browser data files (history, cookies, bookmarks, login data)
- Browser version information when available
- User profiles associated with each browser

## Use Cases

### Red Team
- **Browser Targeting**: Identify which Chromium-based browsers are installed for credential harvesting
- **Data Exfiltration Planning**: Determine which browsers contain potential sensitive information
- **User Profiling**: Understand user browser preferences and usage patterns
- **Pre-Exploitation Reconnaissance**: Identify browsers before deploying browser-specific exploits

### Blue Team
- **Asset Inventory**: Track which browsers are installed across the environment
- **Security Posture**: Identify outdated or unapproved browsers
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Locate browsers that may contain sensitive cached data
- **Compliance Auditing**: Ensure browser usage aligns with organizational policies

## Example Output

```
====== ChromiumPresence ======

  Chrome
    ProfilePath       : C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
    HistoryFile       : Present
    BookmarksFile     : Present
    LoginDataFile     : Present
    CookiesFile       : Present

  Edge
    ProfilePath       : C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default
    HistoryFile       : Present
    BookmarksFile     : Present
    LoginDataFile     : Present
    CookiesFile       : Present
```

## Privilege Context

- **Non-Elevated**: Checks for Chromium browser files in the current user's profile only
- **Elevated**: Checks for Chromium browser files across all user profiles on the system, providing comprehensive browser presence information

## Remote Execution

This command **supports** remote execution (marked with + in the command list).

Remote syntax:
```
Seatbelt.exe ChromiumPresence -computername=TARGET.domain.com -username=DOMAIN\user -password=pass
```

## Detection Considerations

### Indicators
- File system enumeration in browser profile directories
- Access to multiple user AppData directories
- Pattern-based searching for browser-specific file paths
- Rapid sequential access to browser data locations

### Defensive Monitoring
- Monitor access to browser profile directories, especially by non-browser processes
- Alert on enumeration of multiple users' AppData folders
- Track automated tools accessing browser file locations
- Log unusual file system queries targeting browser data paths
- Detect processes reading browser databases without being a browser
