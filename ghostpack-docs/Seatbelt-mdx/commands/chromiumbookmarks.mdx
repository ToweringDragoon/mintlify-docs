## Performance Considerations

This command has minimal performance impact as it only reads bookmark files from disk without executing queries or system calls. Execution time depends on the number of user profiles and bookmarks present.

## Remote Execution

This command supports remote execution via WMI. Use the `-computername` parameter to enumerate bookmarks on remote systems:

```
Seatbelt.exe ChromiumBookmarks -computername=TARGET.domain.com
```

## Detection Considerations

### Indicators
- File access to browser bookmark JSON files
- Read operations on user profile directories
- Access to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\*\Bookmarks`
- Access to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\*\Bookmarks`
- Access to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\User Data\*\Bookmarks`

### Defensive Recommendations
- Monitor for unauthorized access to user profile directories
- Log file access to sensitive browser data locations
- Implement least privilege to restrict profile directory access
- Use AppLocker or similar to control execution of enumeration tools
