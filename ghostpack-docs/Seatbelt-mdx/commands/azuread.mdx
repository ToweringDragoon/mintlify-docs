## Overview

The `azuread` command returns Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) information from the local system. This command enumerates AzureAD configuration and registration details that can reveal the organization's cloud identity integration status.

**Important:** User commands run for the current user if not elevated and for ALL users if elevated.

## Syntax

```
Seatbelt.exe azuread
```

No additional arguments are supported.

## Output

The command returns:
- AzureAD tenant information
- Device registration status
- AzureAD join status
- Associated user and device identities
- Tenant ID and domain information

## Use Cases
