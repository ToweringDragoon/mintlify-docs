## Overview

The AuditPolicies command enumerates both classic and advanced audit policy settings configured on the system. These policies determine what security events are logged by Windows, providing crucial insight into what activities will be visible to defenders through event logs.

Understanding audit policies helps assess the visibility and logging posture of a target system, indicating what actions might be detected or remain unlogged.

## Syntax

```bash
Seatbelt.exe AuditPolicies
```

<Note>
This command does **not** support remote execution. Use [AuditPolicyRegistry](/commands/auditpolicyregistry) for remote enumeration.
</Note>

## Output

The command returns audit policy configuration including:

- Classic audit policies (9 categories)
- Advanced audit policies (subcategories)
- Success/Failure audit settings
- Policy enforcement status
- Category-specific settings

### Audit Categories

<Accordion title="Classic Audit Policy Categories">
- System
- Logon/Logoff
- Object Access
- Privilege Use
- Detailed Tracking
- Policy Change
- Account Management
- Directory Service Access
- Account Logon
</Accordion>

  Kerberos Authentication Service  : Success and Failure
  Process Creation                 : Success
  Logon                            : Success and Failure

  Security Group Management        : Success
```

## Remote Execution

<Warning>
This command does **NOT support remote execution**.
</Warning>

For remote audit policy enumeration, use the [AuditPolicyRegistry](/commands/auditpolicyregistry) command instead, which reads audit settings from the registry and supports the `-computername` parameter.

## Detection Considerations

<Info>
This command has limited detection surface:
</Info>

- **API Calls**: Uses `AuditQuerySystemPolicy` and `AuditEnumerateCategories` APIs
- **Privilege Level**: Typically requires local administrator privileges
- **Event Logs**: May generate Security event 4719 (System audit policy changed) if policy is modified
- **EDR Telemetry**: Security products may log API calls to audit policy functions

### Defensive Recommendations

<Warning>
While enumeration itself is low-risk, it often precedes malicious activity:
</Warning>

- Monitor for execution of reconnaissance tools
- Alert on multiple enumeration commands from single process
- Track access to security policy APIs
- Correlate with other suspicious activities
- Enable process creation logging (Event ID 4688)
- Consider application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized tools

<Tip>
Attackers often check audit policies early in the reconnaissance phase to understand their detection risk. This activity combined with other enumeration is a strong indicator of reconnaissance.
