## Overview

The Services command enumerates Windows services on the system. By default, it filters out Microsoft-signed services to highlight potentially interesting third-party services, custom services, and security products. Use the `-full` flag to enumerate all services without filtering.

## Syntax

```bash
# Filter out Microsoft services (default)
Seatbelt.exe Services

# Enumerate all services
Seatbelt.exe Services -full
```

<Note>
This command does **not** support remote execution for standard enumeration.
</Note>

## Output

Returns service information:
- Service name
- Display name
- Company name
- Service state (Running, Stopped)
- Start type (Auto, Manual, Disabled)
- Service path
- Service account
