## Overview

Perform Kerberos-based password bruteforce attacks against domain accounts. This technique leverages Kerberos pre-authentication to test passwords without triggering traditional account lockout mechanisms in many configurations.

<Warning>
  Password bruteforce attacks can trigger account lockouts and generate significant authentication logs. Use carefully in production environments.
</Warning>

## Syntax

```bash
Rubeus.exe brute /passwords:PASSWORDS [targeting] [options]
```

## Targeting Options

<ParamField path="password" type="string">
  Single password to test against multiple users
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="passwords" type="string">
  File containing list of passwords to test
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="user" type="string">
  Single username to test against multiple passwords
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="users" type="string">
  File containing list of usernames to test
</ParamField>

## Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="domain" type="string">
  Target domain (default: current domain)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dc" type="string">
  Domain controller to target
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="outfile" type="string">
  Output successful credentials to file
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="noticket" type="boolean">
  Don't request TGT for valid credentials
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="verbose" type="boolean">
  Show failed authentication attempts
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Password Spray
# Test single password against multiple users
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password123! /users:C:\temp\users.txt

# Test multiple passwords against single user
Rubeus.exe brute /passwords:C:\temp\passwords.txt /user:admin

# Full matrix attack
Rubeus.exe brute /passwords:C:\temp\passwords.txt /users:C:\temp\users.txt
```

```bash Targeted Attacks
# Test against specific domain
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Summer2024! /users:users.txt /domain:corp.local

# Output results to file
Rubeus.exe brute /passwords:common.txt /users:users.txt /outfile:valid_creds.txt

# Verbose output for debugging
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password123! /users:users.txt /verbose
```

## Attack Strategies

<Accordion title="Password Spraying">
  **Low and Slow:**
  - Test common passwords against many accounts
  - Avoid account lockout by testing few passwords
  - Focus on seasonal/company-specific passwords

  **Common Password Lists:**
  - Password123!, Welcome123!, Summer2024!
  - Company name variations
  - Season + year combinations
  - Default passwords (admin, password, etc.)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Targeted Bruteforce">
  **High-Value Accounts:**
  - Focus on administrative accounts
  - Service accounts with predictable passwords
  - Accounts with known password patterns

  **Intelligence-Driven:**
  - Use OSINT for password hints
  - Company-specific terminology
  - Personal information from social media
</Accordion>

## Evasion and OpSec

<Accordion title="Account Lockout Avoidance">
  **Lockout Policy Awareness:**
  - Understand domain lockout thresholds
  - Stay below lockout attempt limits
  - Implement delays between attempts

  **Safe Testing Strategies:**
  - Test 1-2 passwords per account per day
  - Distribute attempts across time
  - Use multiple source IPs if possible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Detection Avoidance">
  **Timing Strategies:**
  - Perform during business hours
  - Mimic normal authentication patterns
  - Implement random delays

  **Volume Management:**
  - Limit total authentication attempts
  - Rotate target accounts
  - Monitor for defensive responses
</Accordion>
