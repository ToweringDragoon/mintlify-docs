## Summary

Nemesis is a service agent for Mythic - it doesn't generate any payloads, but instead provides an easy interface to work with an external instance of the [Nemesis](https://github.com/SpecterOps/Nemesis) data processing platform.

This doesn't build a payload, but instead generates a "callback" within Mythic that allows you to interact with Nemesis's API.

<Info>
You must set your Nemesis basic auth values as NEMESIS_USERNAME and NEMESIS_PASSWORD as user secrets in the Mythic UI (red key on your operator settings page).
