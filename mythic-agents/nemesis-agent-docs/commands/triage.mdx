## Detailed Summary

This command retrieves file triage information from Nemesis including:

### Triage Details
- Triage value (useful or notuseful)
- Operator who performed the triage
- Expiration timestamp

### File Information
- Project ID
- File magic type (detected file type)
- File name
- Nemesis file type classification
- File tags

### Filtering
The command allows filtering by triage status:
- **useful** - Only show files marked as useful
- **notuseful** - Only show files marked as not useful
- **both** - Show all triaged files (default)

This helps teams:
- Track which files have been reviewed
- Avoid duplicate analysis work
- Focus on files that haven't been triaged yet
- Understand what types of files are being marked as valuable

The triage system in Nemesis allows operators to manually flag files during analysis, creating a collaborative knowledge base about which files are worth investigating in an environment.
