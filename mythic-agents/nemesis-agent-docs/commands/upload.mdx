## Detailed Summary

This command uploads files to Nemesis for processing. Nemesis will automatically:
- Analyze the file type and extract relevant data
- Parse configuration files, browser databases, credential stores, etc.
- Extract hashes and attempt to crack them
- Make the extracted data queryable through its GraphQL API

The upload process:
1. Retrieves the file from Mythic's file store
2. Registers the file with Nemesis's file API
3. Updates the file metadata with agent information, timestamps, and remote path
4. Returns the file ID and object ID for tracking

Files are tagged with the project/operation name and retain their expiration settings from Mythic (default 90 days).
