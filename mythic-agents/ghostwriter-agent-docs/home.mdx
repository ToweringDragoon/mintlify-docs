## Summary

Ghostwriter is a service agent for Mythic - it doesn't generate any payloads, but instead provides an easy interface to work with an external instance of the [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter) project management and reporting platform.

This doesn't build a payload, but instead generates a "callback" within Mythic that allows you to interact with Ghostwriter's GraphQL API.

<Info>
You must generate an API JWT in Ghostwriter and set it as GHOSTWRITER_API_KEY as a user secret in the Mythic UI (red key on your operator settings page).
