## Summary

The command will pop a dialog box for the user asking for them to authenticate (fingerprint reader too) so that the command you entered will be executed in an elevated context. Alternatively, you can supply a username and password and the command will run under their context (assuming they have the right permissions). Once you successfully authenticate, you have a time window where no more popups will occur, but you'll still execute subsequent commands in an elevated context.

WARNING! THIS IS SINGLE THREADED, IF YOUR COMMAND HANGS, THE AGENT HANGS!

## Detailed Summary
This uses the JXA doShellScript command to execute the specified command. A few things to note though:
- This is single threaded, so commands executed in this way have a potential to hang the entire agent
- This spawns `/bin/sh -c [command]` on the command line
- This is actually `/bin/bash` emulating `/bin/sh` which causes some weirdness, so I do some redirection when you try to actually background a task
- This returns results using `\r` instead of `\n` or `\r\n` which is odd, so that is replaced before being returned.

The component that's different between this and the `shell` command is the addition of the `administratorPrivileges` section in the `doShellScript` function:
```javascript
currentApp.doShellScript(cmd, {administratorPrivileges:true,withPrompt:prompt});
```
