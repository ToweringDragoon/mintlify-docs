## Detailed Summary
The JXA mechanism sends Apple Events to the "System Events" application to get some basic security information:
```javascript
let secObj = Application("System Events").securityPreferences();
let info = "automaticLogin: " + secObj.automaticLogin() +
"\nlogOutWhenInactive: " + secObj.logOutWhenInactive() +
"\nlogOutWhenInactiveInterval: " + secObj.logOutWhenInactiveInterval() +
"\nrequirePasswordToUnlock: " + secObj.requirePasswordToUnlock() +
"\nrequirePasswordToWake: " + secObj.requirePasswordToWake();
return {"user_output":info, "completed": true};
```
In Mojave and onward (10.14+) this can cause popups though, so be careful.
