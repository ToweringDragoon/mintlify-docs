## Detailed Summary

You can either type `cat` and get a popup to fill in the path, or provide the path on the command line. This command boils down to a single Objective C call:

```javascript
$.NSString.stringWithContentsOfFileEncodingError($(command_params['path']), $.NSUTF8StringEncoding, $()).js;
```

This expects the contents of the file to be a string. If it's not a string, you should instead `download` the file.
