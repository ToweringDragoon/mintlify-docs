## Detailed Summary
This function uses API calls to chunk and transfer a file down from Mythic to the agent, then uses API calls to write the file out to disk:
```javascript
if(typeof data == "string"){
    data = convert_to_nsdata(data);
}
if (data.writeToFileAtomically($(file_path), true)){
    return "file written";
}
```
After successfully writing the file to disk, the agent will report back the final full path so that it can be tracked within the UI.
