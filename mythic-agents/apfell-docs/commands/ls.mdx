## Detailed Summary
This command used API calls to get the contents of directories and the attributes of files. This includes extended attributes as well which are base64 encoded and returned:
```javascript
ObjC.deepUnwrap(fileManager.attributesOfItemAtPathError($(path), error));
ObjC.deepUnwrap(fileManager.contentsOfDirectoryAtPathError($(path), error));
```

There is also some weirdness that has to happen to get the proper POSIX attributes that people are used to seeing on the command line:
```javascript
let nsposix = attr['NSFilePosixPermissions'];
// we need to fix this mess to actually be real permission bits that make sense
file_add['permissions']['posix'] = ((nsposix >> 6) & 0x7).toString() + ((nsposix >> 3) & 0x7).toString() + (nsposix & 0x7).toString();
```

This command helps populate the file browser, which is where all this data can be seen.
