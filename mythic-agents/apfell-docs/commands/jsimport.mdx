## Summary

Import a JXA file into memory. Only one can be imported at a time. The ideal use case for this is to pull in something like [HealthInspector](https://github.com/its-a-feature/HealthInspector) or [Orchard](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Orchard) to extend your capabilities without having to make an entirely new command. With `jsimport_call` you're able to call functions from within these scripts and return output.
