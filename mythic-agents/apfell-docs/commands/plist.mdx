## Detailed Summary
The plist function uses API calls to read plist files and their associated attributes in an attempt to do privilege escalation or persistence.
- If the `type` is `read`, then the function will look at the specific path indicated by `filename` and read all of that plist
- Otherwise, the function will read all of the `LaunchAgents` or `LaunchDaemons` and give information about their associated programs.

For `LaunchDaemons` and `LaunchAgents`, the function looks at the `ProgramArguments` array as well and returns the permissions on those files since they might not be as protected as the plists themselves.
