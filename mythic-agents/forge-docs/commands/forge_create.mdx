## Summary
Create an entirely new command by uploading your own BOFs, extension.json, or .NET files. This can be as part of a new "collection" or an existing one.
If there's something in a collection's source of available commands already, you can simply register or download it for use within your callbacks.
This is specifically for uploading your own local data.
