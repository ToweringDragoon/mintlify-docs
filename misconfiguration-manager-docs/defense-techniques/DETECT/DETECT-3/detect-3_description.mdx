## Summary
An attacker may use coercion methods to force the the SCCM site server's client push installation accounts to authenticate to an attacker-controlled machine and relay that authentication to another target. This elevation method enables privilege escalation and lateral movement if the attacker targets other systems where the client push installation accounts have administrator privileges, as client push installation requires local administrator privileges to successfully install the client software.

A defender can compare the `Account Name` field of [Event ID: 4624](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624) to that of the `Source_Host` field, or the static IP address of the site server to the `Source Network Address` field. If the site server's domain computer account generates a successful logon event from a source that is not that site server, an NTLM relay attack may have taken place.

The example below displays a successful logon event for a client push installation account from a host that is not the site server.

```
    Source_Host: server2.sccmlab.local
    An account was successfully logged on.
