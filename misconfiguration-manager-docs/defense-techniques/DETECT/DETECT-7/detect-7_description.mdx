## Summary
SCCM contains a `preboot execution environment (PXE)` feature which allows systems to load a specific operating system image on boot.

Attackers can recover domain credentials from PXE media if weak passwords are used, potentially transitioning from an unauthenticated network context to a domain-authenticated one, allowing for privilege escalation and lateral movement.

Several forms of offensive tooling (`sccmhunter`, `pxethief`, `pxethiefy`) will typically follow this operational flow:

1. Connect to the `Distribution Point` via `SMB`
2. Enumerate `“REMINST”` (Remote Install) share (`Windows Deployment Services (WDS)` and often contains PXE boot files)
3. Enumerate `SMSTemp` directory
4. Spider `.var` extensions, which likely contain PXE boot configuration variables

Different tooling will conduct step 2. differently. For example, `sccmhunter's` `smb` module will search and access the `\\.\REMINST\` share path prior to connecting to `SMSTemp` directory. In contrast, `pxethiefy` will utilize the `\\.\IPC$\winreg` named pipe to connect to `SMSTemp`. No one method is `"stealthier"` than the other, as there are opportunities for detection with either connection choice.

Notice that the `SMSTemp` directory is enumerated for `.var` files and `.bcd` files containing credentials or blank passwords. Defenders can monitor the connections to the `\\REMINST\` file share and the `SMSTemp` directory with `Event ID: 5145` and SACLs set on the `SMSTemp` directory.

The below example displays a successful `Event ID 5145` generation upon the connection to `\\REMINST\` file share:

```
Event ID: 5145
A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access.
