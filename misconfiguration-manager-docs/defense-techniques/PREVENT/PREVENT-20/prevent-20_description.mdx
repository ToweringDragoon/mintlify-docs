## Summary
> **IMPORTANT:** These protocols may be necessary to permit in your environment, depending on the configuration. For example, it may be difficult to block SMB traffic to site servers if they are also distribution points, or to HTTP(S) if they are both a management point and an SMS Provider. Review the referenced documentation and test thoroughly prior to implementing these rules in production.

To help prevent NTLM coercion and relay and remote management from untrusted, non-admin networks, block connections from **unnecessary** sources to site systems via protocols and ports that can be used for coercion, relay, and remote management, including:
- HTTPS and WMI traffic to SMS Providers
- MSSQL traffic to site databases
- SMB traffic to primary (including CAS) and passive site servers
